# Population Visualizations Server
Express server for the
[population visualizations site](http://population.blackmarket.services),
which lets users visualize different data related to mobility in the United
States on a chloropleth map.

# Running
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

If running on the production server, also do:
```bash
source ./.env
```
That file is not in this repo though for reasons
